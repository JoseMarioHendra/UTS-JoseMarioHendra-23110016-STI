                        <p>Back in my high school days, I started my part-time career after being offered a position in the restaurant and coffee industry. My former workplace, a restaurant that also served as a coffee shop, provided me with invaluable experiences. It was there that I discovered my passion for serving customers with warmth and helping them find their favorite menu items, such as <i>kuo tie</i> and matcha latte, which were personal favorites of mine. As a waiter, I learned the importance of teamwork and efficiency in customer service. My time at my former workplace shaped me into an individual ready to tackle challenges with enthusiasm and provide exceptional dining experiences for every guest. After completing my high school education, I made the decision to full-time work, as my schooling days came to an end. This choice was influenced by the end of my academic journey and the beginning of the holiday season.</p>

In this role, I hold responsibilities as an administrator, trainer, support, and technician. Every day, I interact with customers, providing consultation on the usage of our software, and performing necessary maintenance and upkeep. My main focus is to ensure that our customers can optimize the use of the software, maintain smooth system operations, and provide necessary support to keep their businesses productive and successful.

This helps customers feel more confident in managing the accounting aspects of their business.</p>
