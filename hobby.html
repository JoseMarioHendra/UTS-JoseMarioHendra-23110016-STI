                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Piano/Keyboard</li>
                        <p>With the perfect pitch ability that I realized since the age of six, I began to explore the world of music by playing the piano. This musical skill laid the foundation for my participation in various music competitions and contributions to church music. Through this journey, I not only explored my musical potential but also found ways to share my skills in music with others, both through performances on stage and in the spiritual context of the church.</p>
                        <li>Guitar</li>
                        <p>Perhaps due to my perfect pitch and proficiency in playing the piano, picking up the guitar came a bit easier for me. Learning from a friend, I quickly grasped the basics and delved into fingerstyle playing. Though my skills are still at a basic level, the foundation laid by my musical background enabled me to navigate the frets with relative ease. This newfound ability in fingerstyle guitar, albeit rudimentary, adds another dimension to my musical journey.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cube</li>
                        <p>From 2x2 to 5x5 cubes, I've explored the world of Rubik's Cube with determination and curiosity. Each size presents a new challenge in my journey, teaching valuable problem-solving skills and patience.</p>
                        <li>Unique Cube</li>
                        <p>My experience in exploring various types of cubes, from 2x2 to 5x5, has been an extraordinary adventure. As a Rubik's enthusiast, I also enjoy the challenges posed by other puzzles like pyraminx, megaminx, square-1, skewb, and mirror-cube. Each cube provides me with an opportunity to hone my problem-solving skills and patience, while adding a new dimension to my journey with Rubik's Cube. I still aspire to expand my Rubik's collection.</p>

                        <li>History</li>
                        <p>During the 2020 pandemic, when I had to stay home most of the time, I discovered a new joy in watching anime. Initially recommended by a friend, I started with Nisekoi, and from there, my interest in anime grew. I also enjoyed Your Lie in April, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Attack on Titan. Through anime, I found enjoyable entertainment and compelling stories.</p>
                        <li>Recommendation</li>
                        <p><b>Your Lie in April</b>, takes viewers on an emotional journey of love and healing through captivating music.
                            <br>
                            <b>Attack on Titan</b>, brings thrilling action with numerous unexpected plot twists and a suspenseful storyline.
                            <br>
                            Works from <b>Studio Ghibli</b>, such as “Spirited Away” or “Princess Mononoke,” provide an enchanting experience in a fantasy world. By combining these three anime, viewers will discover a variety of fascinating experiences without getting trapped in darkness.</p>
